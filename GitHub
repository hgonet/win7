[[File:GithubAWSTorontoSummit.jpg|thumb|GitHub at AWS Summit]]
GitHub was developed by [[Chris Wanstrath]], [[P. J. Hyett]], [[Tom Preston-Werner]] and [[Scott Chacon]] using [[Ruby on Rails]], and started in February 2008. The company, GitHub, Inc., has existed since 2007 and is located in San Francisco.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.heise.de/developer/meldung/GitHub-populaerer-als-SourceForge-und-Google-Code-1255416.html|title=GitHub populärer als SourceForge und Google Code|first=Alexander|last=Neumann|website=heise Developer}}</ref>

=== Acquisition by Microsoft ===
On June 4, 2018, [[Microsoft]] announced its intent to acquire GitHub for US$7.5 billion, and the deal closed on Oct. 26, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/microsoft-completes-github-acquisition/ar-BBOVVOT |title=Microsoft completes GitHub acquisition |publisher=Msn.com |date=2018-10-26 |accessdate=2019-03-18}}</ref> GitHub will continue to operate independently as a community, platform and business. Under Microsoft, the service will be led by [[Xamarin]]'s [[Nat Friedman]], reporting to [[Scott Guthrie]], executive vice president of Microsoft Cloud and AI. Current CEO Chris Wanstrath will be retained as a "technical fellow", also reporting to Guthrie. Microsoft had become a significant user of GitHub, using it to host open source projects and development tools such as [[Chakra (JavaScript engine)|Chakra Core]], [[PowerShell]], and [[Visual Studio Code]], and has backed other open source projects such as [[Linux]], and developed [[Git Virtual File System]]—a Git extension for managing large-scale repositories (and itself has been adopted by GitHub).<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-confirms-it-will-acquire-github-for-7-5-billion/|title=Microsoft confirms it will acquire GitHub for $7.5 billion|date=June 4, 2018|work=VentureBeat|access-date=June 4, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

Some{{Who|date=August 2018}} saw this as a culmination of Microsoft's recent changes in business strategy under CEO [[Satya Nadella]], which has seen a larger focus on the sale of [[cloud computing]] services as its main line of business, alongside development of and contributions to open source software (such as [[Linux]]), as opposed to the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/1295693/github-users-already-fuming-about-companys-sale-to-microsoft/|title=GitHub users are already fuming about the company's sale to Microsoft|last=Horwitz|first=Josh|work=Quartz|access-date=June 9, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-has-acquired-github-for-7-5b-in-microsoft-stock/|title=Microsoft has acquired GitHub for $7.5B in stock|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US|access-date=June 4, 2018}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/4/17422788/microsoft-github-acquisition-official-deal|title=Microsoft confirms it will acquire GitHub for $7.5 billion|work=The Verge|access-date=June 4, 2018}}</ref> ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' argued that Microsoft was intending to acquire GitHub to get access to its userbase, so it can be used as a [[loss leader]] to encourage use of its other development products and services.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2018/06/why-microsoft-is-willing-to-pay-so-much-for-github|title=Why Microsoft Is Willing to Pay So Much for GitHub|date=June 6, 2018|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=June 9, 2018}}</ref>

=== GitHub ===
Development of the GitHub platform began on October 19, 2007.<ref name="beginning">{{cite web |url = https://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2014/02/10/github-ceo-and-co-founder-chris-wanstrath-keynoting-esris-devsummit/ |title = GitHub CEO and Co-Founder Chris Wanstrath Keynoting Esri's DevSummit! |first1 = Kristina |last1 = Weis |date = February 10, 2014 |quote = in 2007 they began working on GitHub as a side project }}</ref><ref name="githuboneyear">{{cite web |url = https://github.com/blog/185-github-turns-one |title = GitHub Turns One! |work = GitHub |date = October 19, 2008 |first = Tom |last = Preston-Werner |accessdate = March 28, 2014 }}</ref><ref name="githubfirstcommit">{{cite web |url = https://www.slideshare.net/err/inside-github/28-2007_octoberThe_rst_commit_was |title = The ﬁrst commit was on a Friday night in October, around 10&nbsp;pm. |date = December 7, 2009 |first = Chris |last = Wanstrath |accessdate = November 4, 2017 }}</ref> The site was launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P.

Projects on GitHub can be accessed and manipulated using the standard Git command-line interface and all of the standard Git commands work with it. GitHub also allows registered and non-registered users to browse public repositories on the site. Multiple desktop clients and Git [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]]s have also been created by GitHub and other third parties that integrate with the platform.

The site provides [[social networking]]-like functions such as feeds, followers, wikis (using [[wiki software]] called [[Gollum Wiki|Gollum]]) and a [[Collaboration graph|social network graph]] to display how developers work on their versions ("[[fork (software development)|forks]]") of a repository and what fork (and branch within that fork) is newest.

A user must create an account in order to contribute content to the site, but public repositories can be browsed and downloaded by anyone. With a registered user account, users are able to have discussions, manage repositories, submit contributions to others' repositories, and [[code review|review changes to code]].

The fundamental software that underpins GitHub is [[Git]] itself, written by [[Linus Torvalds]], creator of Linux.  The additional software that provides the GitHub user interface was written using [[Ruby on Rails]] and [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]] by GitHub, Inc. developers Wanstrath,<ref name="wanstrathinterview">{{cite web |url = http://doeswhat.com/2012/03/06/interview-with-chris-wanstrath-github/ |title = Interview with Chris Wanstrath |publisher = Doeswhat.com |date = March 6, 2012 |accessdate = February 26, 2013 }}</ref> Hyett, and Preston-Werner.

==== Scope ====
GitHub is mostly used for code.

In addition to [[source code]], GitHub supports the following formats and features:

* Unified and split diffs
* Email notifications
* Option to subscribe someone to notifications by [[Mention (blogging)|@ mentioning]] them.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://github.com/blog/821 |title = Mention @somebody. They're notified. |work = GitHub |accessdate = April 30, 2016 }}</ref>
* [[Emoji]]s<ref>{{cite web |url = https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/ |title = Github Help / Categories / Writing on GitHub |publisher = Github.com |accessdate = April 30, 2016 }}</ref>
* [[GitHub Pages]]: small websites can be hosted from public repositories on GitHub. The URL format is https://''username''.github.io.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pages.github.com/|title=GitHub Pages}}</ref>
* Nested [[to do list|task-lists]] within files
* Visualization of [[Geospatial analysis|geospatial]] data
* 3D render files that can be previewed using a new integrated STL file viewer that displays the files on a "3D canvas".<ref name="3d">{{cite web |url = https://makezine.com/2013/04/09/github-now-supports-stl-file-viewing/ |title = GitHub Now Supports STL File Viewing |date = April 9, 2013 |last1 = Weinhoffer |first1 = Eric }}</ref> The viewer is powered by [[WebGL]] and [[Three.js]].
* Photoshop's native PSD format can be previewed and compared to previous versions of the same file.
* PDF document viewer
* Security Alerts of known [[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures]] in different packages

==== Licensing of repositories ====
GitHub's Terms of Service do not require public software projects hosted on GitHub to meet the [[Open Source Definition]]. For that reason, it is essential for users and developers intending to use a piece of software found on GitHub to read the [[software license]] in the repository (usually found in a top-level file called "LICENSE", "LICENSE.txt", or similar) to determine if it meets their needs{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}.
The [[Terms of Service]] state, "By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and fork your repositories."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/ |title=GitHub Terms of Service - User Documentation |publisher=Help.github.com |date=February 11, 2016 |accessdate=December 5, 2016}}</ref>

=== GitHub Enterprise ===
GitHub Enterprise is similar to GitHub's public service but is designed for use by large-scale enterprise software development teams where the enterprise wishes to host their repositories behind a corporate [[firewall (computing)|firewall]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://github.com/blog/978-introducing-github-enterprise |accessdate = July 13, 2014 |title = Introducing GitHub Enterprise |publisher = GitHub }}</ref>

=== Gist ===
GitHub also operates other services: a [[pastebin]]-style site called '''Gist'''<ref name="pastie"/> that is for hosting [[Snippet (programming)|code snippets]] (GitHub proper is for hosting larger projects).

Tom Preston-Werner presented the then-new Gist feature at a punk rock Ruby conference in 2008.<ref>{{cite conference |title = God's memory leak - a scientific treatment |first = Tom |last = Preston-Werner |url = https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/god-rb/Acyit8SlgcI |date = July 20, 2008 |conference = RubyFringe |conferenceurl = https://unspace.ca/rubyfringe/ |accessdate = October 21, 2014 |quote = He previewed the upcoming git feature gist }}</ref> Gist builds on the traditional simple concept of a [[pastebin]] by adding version control for code snippets, easy forking, and SSL encryption for private pastes. Because each "gist" has its own Git repository, multiple code snippets can be contained in a single paste and they can be pushed and pulled using Git. Further, forked code can be pushed back to the original author in the form of a patch, so gists (pastes) can become more like mini-projects.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}

=== Education program ===
GitHub launched a new program called the GitHub Student Developer Pack to give students free access to popular development tools and services. GitHub partnered with [[Bitnami]], [[Crowdflower]], [[DigitalOcean]], [[DNSimple]], [[HackHands]], [[Namecheap]], Orchestrate, Screenhero, [[SendGrid]], [[Stripe (company)|Stripe]], [[Travis CI]] and [[Unreal Engine]] to launch the program.<ref>{{cite web|first=Frederic|last=Lardinois|publisher=TechCrunch|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/07/github-partners-with-digital-ocean-unreal-engine-and-others-to-give-students-free-access-to-developer-tools/|title=GitHub Partners With Digital Ocean, Unreal Engine, Others To Give Students Free Access To Developer Tools|date=October 7, 2014|access-date=October 7, 2014}}</ref>

In 2016 GitHub announced the launch of the GitHub Campus Experts program<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.blog/2016-06-25-github-campus-experts-technology-leadership-at-your-school/|title=GitHub Campus Experts - Technology leadership at your school|date=2016-06-25|website=The GitHub Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-22}}</ref> to train and encourage students to grow technology communities at their universities. The Campus Experts program is open to university students of 18 years and older across the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://education.github.com/experts|title=GitHub Campus Experts|website=GitHub Education|access-date=2019-01-22}}</ref> GitHub Campus Experts are one of the primary ways that GitHub funds student oriented events and communities, Campus Experts are given access to training, funding, and additional resources to run events and grow their communities. To become a Campus Expert applicants must complete an online training course consisting of multiple modules designed to grow community leadership skills. 

=== GitHub Marketplace service ===
GitHub also provides some [[software as a service]] integrations for adding extra features to projects. Those services include:
* Waffle.io: Project management for software teams. Automatically see pull requests, automated builds, reviews, and deployments across all of your repositories in GitHub.
* Rollbar: Integrate with GitHub to provide real time debugging tools and full-stack exception reporting. It is compatible with all well used code languages, such as [[JavaScript]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[.NET]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[PHP]], [[Node.js]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS]], [[Go (programming language)|Go]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]].
* Codebeat: For automated code analysis specialized in web and mobile developers. The supported languages for this software are: [[Elixir (programming language)|Elixir]], [[Go (programming language)|Go]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]], [[JavaScript]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Kotlin (programming language)|Kotlin]], [[Objective-C]], and [[TypeScript]].
* [[Travis CI]]: To provide confidence for your apps while doing test and ship. Also gives full control over the build environment, to adapt it to the code. Supported languages: [[Go (programming language)|Go]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JavaScript]], [[Objective-C]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[PHP]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], and [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]].
* GitLocalize: Developed for teams that are translating their content from one point to another. GitLocalize automatically syncs with your repository so you can keep your workflow on GitHub. It also keeps you updated on what needs to be translated.

=== GitHub Sponsors ===
GitHub Sponsors allows users to make monthly money donations to projects hosted on GitHub. The public beta was announced on May 23, 2019 and currently the project accepts wait list registrations. [[The Verge]] said that GitHub Sponsors "works exactly like Patreon" because "developers can offer various funding tiers that come with different perks, and they’ll receive recurring payments from supporters who want to access them and encourage their work" except with "zero fees to use the program". Furthermore, GitHub offer incentives for early adopters during the first year: it pledges to cover payment processing costs, and match sponsorship payments up to $5,000 per developer. Furthermore, users still can use other similar services like [[Patreon]] and Open Collective and link to their own websites.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/23/18637344/github-sponsors-patreon-style-crowdfunding-open-source|title=GitHub launches Sponsors, a Patreon-style funding tool for developers|last=Kastrenakes|first=Jacob|date=2019-05-23|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.blog/2019-05-23-announcing-github-sponsors-a-new-way-to-contribute-to-open-source/|title=Announcing GitHub Sponsors: a new way to contribute to open source|date=2019-05-23|website=The GitHub Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref>
